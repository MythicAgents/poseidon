- Removed `execute_macho` command since it causes instability between multiple runs
  - `execute_macho` terminates the entire program when executing a universal/fat binary
- Updated `execute_memory` to `execute_library` and drop a dylib to disk and run it instead of using `NSCreateObjectFileImageFromMemory`
  - `NSCreateObjectFileImageFromMemory` writes out the macho/dylib to `/private/tmp/NSCreateObjectFileImageFromMemory-XXXX` and then calls `dlopen` on it; this removed its "memory execution" and made it much easier to detect
  - `execute_library` requires that symbols exist in the library/executable

- Added support for ARM compilations

### Changed
